# GRAFTERS

A car-jacker at a crossroads.

We follow Kurt, an expert car-thief, whose life is suddenly complicated by offbeat romance and professional competition.

Kurt works for Larry, a father figure who runs a chop shop disguised as a garage, but Kurt's career is threatened by Joe, a lowly mechanic and aspiring car thief.

Meanwhile, romance buds for Kurt with Emilie, a young mother with complications of her own. Kurt's personal and professional life are speeding towards a dangerous intersection.

GRAFTERS asks: 

Can a low-life take the high road?
